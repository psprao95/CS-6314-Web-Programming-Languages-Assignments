Due date: September 12, 2018, 11:59PM 

1. Create below signup form using HTML and Bootstrap. 

2. When the form is submitted (user clicks the Signup button), validate the user input by using JQuery.  

3. Validation rules: 
   * All fields are mandatory. 
   * Passwords should match.
   * User should accept the terms of use. 

4. Set up an event listener on the form’s submit event so that the code prevents submission of the form (preventDefault()) if there is any validation error, but otherwise submits the form. For the elements that have a validation error, highlight the element by changing style properties of it (i.e. you can change the border color or background color to red).

5. Include a notification at the top of the page and let the user know highlighted elements have validation errors.

6. Add another listener to the fields so that when the user types into a field (changed event), remove the color you just added.
