1.	login.html - Create a form that contains two input fields: username and password. When the form is submitted, it should go to login.php

2.	login.php

Check if both fields are given. If they are given, check username and password with database and store user information (username) in a session variable if both are correct. Redirect user to books.php.
If user input is missing in one of the input fields or username/password doesn’t match with database entries, redirect user to login.html. You don’t need to display any error messages.

3.	books.php

If the user has signed in, show the list of the books and show the search box. Otherwise, take the user to login.html. On the books listing, include a link/button for each book for adding it to the cart.

4.	cart.php

Add the selected book to the cart. You can implement the cart functionality by using a database table. 

shoppingcart (UserName, BookID)

If the user attempts to add the same book to the cart, display an info message that says the book is already in the cart.

Show the book titles that are in the cart along with their prices. Show cart total. 

At the end of the page, include a link (“Continue Shopping”) for books.php.

5.	logout.php

Sign out the user by destroying session variables.
