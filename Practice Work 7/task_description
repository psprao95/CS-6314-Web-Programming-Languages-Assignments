Implement a simple RESTful web service by using PHP.

Your web service should provide information about books. 

http://localhost/books should give list of books that are stored in your database. 

Response generated by the web service can be in JSON or XML format.
Ã¥
Your database (database name: PW7) will have following table:

Book (Book_id, title, year, price, category)

You can use books.xml to populate your table.

Deliverables: Zip index.php and screenshot of your result into yournetid-PW7.zip and send through eLearning.

You will need to configure your MAMP server to define an end point (URL) for your web service.

How to configure MAMP for Mac OS:

Create api folder under /Applications/MAMP/htdocs directory.

Save index.php under /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/api directory.

Add below line to  /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/httpd.conf file:
Alias /books "/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/api/index.php"

How to configure MAMP for Windows:

Create api folder under C:/MAMP/htdocs directory.

Save index.php under C:/MAMP/htdocs/api directory.

Add below line to C:/MAMP/conf/apache/httpd.conf file:
Alias /books "C:/MAMP/htdocs/api/index.php"

Restart apache server.

Check your api at http://localhost/books.

Important reminder:  Make sure your database name, table name and attribute names match with given names. You also make sure to use default hostname, username and password for database connection. (host: localhost, username: root, password: root). Otherwise you will lose points for not complying with the standards of the assignment.
