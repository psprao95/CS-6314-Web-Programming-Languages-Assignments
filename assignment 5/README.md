Create a video rental web application by using **MEAN stack**.

1. Your application should include all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for manipulating videos.

2. Add images to video listing and video details (edit) page. You don’t need to automatically upload pictures.  Store your images under “public/images” folder and name each image as  “{video._id}.jpg”. There is no restriction on image file format thus you can use any format. (jpg, jpeg, png, etc.)


Deliverables:
1. Zipped application folder.
2. Screenshot for video listing page.
3. Screenshot for video detail (edit) page.
4. Screenshot of the list of documents in mongodb.
